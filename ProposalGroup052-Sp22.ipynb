    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "Our goal for this project is to examine historical stock and homicide reports data from 2000 to 2014 to see if we can create a predictor from stock data to homicides. the stock data is stock data from the current 30 members of the DOW Jones members, dating back to when they joined or 2000. The Homicide data goes from 1980 to 2014, so we will use the overlap from 2000 to 2014. With this data we will choose and fit a regression model and try ommitting cerain years or months for testing. Success will be determined by examining the accuracy of our predictor on the test data."

Specifically looking at historical data, income and unemployment rate have been found to have a very large impact on crime rate increasing or decreasing, and in this project we hope to see if different measures can be found to have a simialr correlation at the very least."

This approach could then be expanded to address more specific communities and predict when crime rate might increase based on the economic performance of local businesses etc."

    "- Each data point is one reported crime.\n",
    "- The critical variable for this dataset will be the date.\n",
    "- For cleaning, we will have to transform the data to be in a time series, so that we can count the amount of crime per day or month as opposed to having a list of each crime."
